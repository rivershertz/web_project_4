# [Around The U.S.](https://rivershertz.github.io/web_project_4/)
### Front-end development - HTML|CSS|JS

#### Description
This project containes a social media feed clone
##### Phase 1
At this stage you can edit the profile "name" and "about me" fields but the values wont be saved after a refresh is done to the page because the site isnt connected to a data-base. In this phase, I have implemented my first lines of JavaScript and it was a lot of fun and very interesting to try a different method of creation which is not very visual like css.

##### Phase 2
New features have been added!
The "Add" button - This button allowes the user to add new cards to his feed. The user can give the card a title of his choice and should provide a link to the source file of the picture.
The card popup - If the user clicks on the image in each card a popup window containing a larger version of the picture will open.
In this part of the project I can say that my coding skills definetly grew, and I've deepend my understanding of event, functions and iterating threw arrays.
Lots of fun!

##### Phase 3
Once again - new features!
Form validation - The user gets informed with an error message if any input field in any form is invalid. The error message describes the exact problem with the input the user types with his every key stroke.
Closing the forms - The user can close the forms by clicking on the overlay behind the form or by hitting Esc on the keyboard.

##### Phase 4
Refactoring time!
All of the website's functionallity is based on classes and modules and they all come together in index.js.
Webpack has been integrated and now the source files are all compact and fit all browsers.
