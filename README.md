## Project 4:
# [Around The U.S.]
### Interactive and functional web development part-1

#### Description
This project containes a fake feed in a social media fashion, at this stage you can edit the profile "name" and "about me" fields but the values wont be saved after a refresh is done to the page because the site isnt connected to a data-base. In this project, I have implemented my first lines of JavaScript and it was a lot of fun and very interesting to try a different method of creation which is not very visual like css.

##### Technologies
* HTML
* css
* JavaScript
